# Rewards System Explained

## Two Types of Progression

### 1. **Level Progression** (Overall Player Level)
- **What it is**: Your overall player level (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, etc.)
- **How you earn it**: By accumulating **total points** across ALL activities
- **Progression**: Every 100 points = 1 level up
- **What it shows**: Your overall mastery and dedication
- **Display**: Shown in gold "Level Badge" on main menu

**Example**: Complete 5 activities → earn 150 points → reach Level 2

### 2. **Activity Difficulty** (Per-Game Progression)
- **What it is**: Each game has 3 difficulty levels (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- **How you earn it**: By **completing that specific game**
- **Progression**: 
  - First time = Easy (⭐)
  - Second time = Medium (⭐⭐)  
  - Third time = Hard (⭐⭐⭐)
- **What it shows**: Your mastery of each individual activity
- **Display**: Stars under each game card on main menu
- **Effect**: Game gets progressively harder (more cards, more shapes, bigger grids, etc.)

**Example**: 
- Play Coloring Game 1st time → 8 shapes to color (Easy)
- Click "Next Level" button → 13 shapes to color (Medium)
- Click "Next Level" button → 20 shapes to color (Hard)

- **Visual display**: See your locked (gray) and unlocked (gold) achievements

This creates a rich progression system where:

- Special moments are celebrated (achievements)
- Everything works together to keep you engaged and motivated!
